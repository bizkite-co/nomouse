## Integration with Payroll and handling complex rules for payroll
Time & attendance needs to handle complex payroll calculations (e.g. variable pay rates) and eliminate the manual and time consuming process of reconciling time-logs from the field for payroll processing. 
Basic time tracking solutions are unable to handle the complex jobs tracking & payroll requirements of mid-size and enterprise businesses. First, highly accurate time tracking prevents payroll teams from having to manually fix and update errors in time sheets. Second, the time tracking system integrates with any payroll system so that employee hours & mileage can be synced without any manual process. And third, businesses can define and apply complex rules to handle varying pay rates for employees and for jobs so that payroll processing is faster and easier.
