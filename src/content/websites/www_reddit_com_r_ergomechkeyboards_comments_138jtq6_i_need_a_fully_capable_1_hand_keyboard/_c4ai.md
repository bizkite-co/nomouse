#  I need a fully capable 1 hand keyboard 
[ [help]  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/?f=flair_name%3A%22%5Bhelp%5D%22)
The chronic issues with my right hand have gotten worse. I need a keyboard that is fully capable that i can use only with my left hand. This is as a programmer too so i need a full keyboard plus symbols. What should i do. I primarily code in c and c++ but will be having to make some websites too. My whole computer is configured to run with only keyboard shortcuts (i use arch linux with i3wm and vim bindings for everything). I also need the esc key on the keyboard although caps lock isn't necessary
