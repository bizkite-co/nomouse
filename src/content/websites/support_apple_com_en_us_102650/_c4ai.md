# Mac keyboard shortcuts
By pressing certain key combinations, you can take actions that normally require a mouse or trackpad. Every app can have its own shortcuts, and shortcuts that work in one app might not work in another.
  * [Using keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650#about)
  * [Cut, copy, paste, and other common shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650#copy)
  * [Sleep, log out, and shut down shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650#sleep)
  * [Finder and system shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650#finder)
  * [Text-editing shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650#text)
  * [Accessibility shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650#accessibility)
  * [App-specific shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650#other)
  * [Learn more](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650#more)


## Using keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts use one or more of these modifier keys, which in menus are [abbreviated using symbols](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-are-those-symbols-shown-in-menus-cpmh0011/mac):
  * Fn (Function) or Globe![ ](https://cdsassets.apple.com/live/7WUAS350/images/mac/mac-fn-key-globe-icon.png)
  * Control (or Ctrl) ⌃
  * Option (or Alt) ⌥
  * Shift ⇧
  * Command (or Cmd) ⌘


To use a shortcut, press and hold the modifier keys, then press the last key of the shortcut. For example, to use Command-C, press and hold the Command key, then the C key, then release both keys. (On keyboards made for Windows PCs, press the Alt key instead of Option, and the Ctrl key or Windows logo key instead of Command.)
The keys in the top row of many Apple keyboards have special symbols and functions, such as for brightness![ ](https://cdsassets.apple.com/live/7WUAS350/images/inline-icons/keyboard-icon-increase-display-brightness.png), Mission Control![](https://cdsassets.apple.com/live/7WUAS350/images/accessories/keyboards/mac-keyboard-touch-bar-mission-control-icon.png), and more. To use these keys as F1, F2, F3, or other standard function keys, combine them with the Fn key.
