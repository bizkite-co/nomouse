# Keyboard Community
Mar 6
Written By [Terry Mathews](https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses?author=61017a5ab6bfbd48737c7f07)
The Mechanical Keyboards community is a diverse and global one, with many existing tools and forums to help you learn about the space, get you involved with new products, and even launch your own initiative. With so much to explore, we’ll be breaking down the key platforms.

## Syllabus
**Community Websites** – Reddit and Geekhack
**Meetups** – Build relationships and try keyboards
**Discord** – Keeping up-to-date
## Community Websites

Mechanical Keyboards Subreddit
If we’re talking about all things hobby-related, the [r/mk subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards) is the place to go. With over 500k subscribers, r/mk gives you your fill of product announcements, community discussions, new custom builds, and plenty of memes to tide you over while you wait for your next shipment.
Although Reddit is the most comprehensive on the latest happenings and activities, it is also the most overwhelming with new information easily buried after a hot moment before new content stacks on.

Geekhack
This old-school looking forum is the most active in terms of learning about upcoming products in development, current products sold in Group Buys, and other services regarding keyboards. 
You can create a personal profile and follow whatever pages and products interest you. [Geekhack](https://geekhack.org/) is the best place to get updates on specific products you’re interested in while keeping an eye on the latest offerings.

MechMarket Subreddit
[MechMarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket), is the go-to place for selling and buying aftermarket keyboard products. Since many custom keyboards and keysets are not kept in stock and instead sold through limited [Group Buys](https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses/group-buy), this subreddit is your best bet in getting your hands on that desired product. Many vendors will also announce their new products here. 
## Meetups
If you’re looking for more in-person interaction, meetups are the way to go. There is a global community of keyboard fans out there and meetup events are a fantastic way to try out boards, make new friends, and get hands-on experience that websites simply can’t offer. 
Meetups can range from big gatherings like Keycon that happen once a year, local meetups by city, or just several enthusiasts bringing their boards to a local pub for a pint and good ol’ typing tests. 
Common to all meetups though are the gallery of boards available to try. People bring their own builds to showcase, and each one is labeled with the specs.
This is by far the best way to decide on what you like and what you might pass on. The keyboard hobby is all about preference, so getting to play around with different builds is the perfect way to narrow down your switch choices, preferred formats, and colorways. It’s hard to understand how something feels from reading about it or watching a video—the experience of typing on the keyboards yourself can’t be replaced.

**Meetup Perks**
  * Meet other hobbyists
  * Try out custom builds
  * Learn more about keyboards


## Getting Social on Discord
While Geekhack acts as a type of bulletin board for upcoming and group buy products, you’ll likely find yourself wanting to learn more in terms of updates, and interact with fellow fans of the keyboard, caps, and other products you’re getting in on. 
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/), a community chatting app, is a great place to interact with other keyboard folks. Many vendors and designers have their own Discord servers, where they discuss their products; there are also keyboard servers for specific countries and regions, which is a great way to connect with your local community. 
In any given channel, you’ll find general conversations, product-specific updates, and all manner of fun stuff to get into along with your keyboard companions.
Discord is also a great place to ask for help—there’s a community of people who are ready to share their knowledge with you and help you through the steps of building your first keyboard, or troubleshooting an issue, or choosing what to buy, and more.

## Community Survey Results
The Key Company ran a short community survey back in December 2019. How long have you been into keyboards? How would you introduce your friends to this hobby?

And these are the best ways to get into the keyboard hobby. There’s plenty to explore further in more forums, on Instagram, and others.
