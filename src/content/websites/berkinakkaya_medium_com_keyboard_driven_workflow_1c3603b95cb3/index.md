This article advocates for a keyboard-driven workflow to improve speed and efficiency when using a computer. It argues that using keyboard shortcuts is faster than using a mouse for tasks like opening programs, switching tabs, and navigating websites.

**Key points:**

*   **Opening & Closing Apps & Tabs:** Use the Windows key + number to open apps in the taskbar (Windows). Use App Launchers like Rofi (Linux) or Alfred (Mac). Change the shortcut for closing apps to something easier to reach (e.g., Super+Q). Use Control+W to close browser tabs and Control+T to open new ones.
*   **Switching Between Apps & Tabs:** Use Control+Tab and Control+Shift+Tab to switch between browser tabs. Use Control+Number to go to a specific tab. Use Alt+Tab to switch between apps, but consider using multiple workspaces for better organization.
*   **Workspaces & Tiling Window Managers:** Using multiple workspaces is highly recommended. Tiling Window Managers (Linux) automatically manage window positions, eliminating the need for manual resizing and dragging.
*   **Browsing:** Use the Vimium extension (Firefox, Chrome) to click links via keyboard. In Firefox or Chrome, type directly in a new tab to search, or use Control+L to focus the address bar.
*   **Using The Keyboard Faster:** Avoid holding down keys or pressing them repeatedly. Use Control+Backspace to delete words. Use the Delete key to delete characters or words in front of the cursor.
