# The Big List of 140+ Keyboard Shortcuts For You Most Used Online Tools
Apr 18, 2023
[ ![Kevan Lee](https://buffer.com/library/content/images/size/w100/2020/05/Kevan-Lee.png) **Kevan Lee** Former VP of Marketing @ Buffer ](https://buffer.com/library/author/kevanlee/)
**Summary**
11 min read
**You will learn**
Isaac Newton discovered gravity. I discovered what a four-finger swipe does on my Macbook.
The discoveries will not go down the same in history, but I have to admit: I was pretty stoked to find mine.
Little epiphanies like these are hugely satisfying when I’m trying to squeeze just a little more time out of each and every day. A second or two here becomes a minute or two there. It’s an awesome feeling to sense that you’re working just as fast as possible.
We’re always looking to work smarter, not harder, here at Buffer, and we often hunt for keyboard shortcuts in our favorite apps, tools, and services. We thought it might be useful to share some of our discoveries (and favorites) with you.
With the shortcuts you see below, I’ve listed most with their Mac keyboard names and shortcuts. If you’re using a Windows keyboard, in most cases you can replace the Command on a Mac with Control on a PC.
## **Common keyboard shortcuts**
Before we get in too deep, I wanted to quickly review a handful of common shortcuts that are helpful to know in a variety of different apps and services. You might already be familiar with these, but just in case:
<Command>+c = copy
<Command>+x = cut
<Command>+v = paste
<Command>+q = quit
<Command>+w = close window
<Command>+n = open new
<Command>+s = save
<Command>+p = print
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Gmail**
We’ve built quite the system for the way that we use Gmail at Buffer. [As a distributed team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7d9vYswRig&noredirect=1), it’s imperative that we stay in touch as often as possible and make connections on as many different points as can be. Email can get deep and wide pretty fast. Here’s how we combat it:
e = archive email and return to inbox
] = archive email and go to next email (returns to inbox if you’re at the last email)
g then i = go to inbox
<Shift>+u = mark unread
c = compose a new email
r = reply to sender
a = reply-all
<Command>+<Shift>+c = add cc recipients
<Command>+<Shift>+b = add bcc recipients
To see the full list of Gmail shortcuts, simply type a question mark from anywhere inside Gmail.
Note: If keyboard shortcuts don’t seem to be working, check your Gmail settings for the on/off switch.
![](https://buffer.com/library/content/images/2023/04/Gmail-Shortcuts-Logo.png)
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Twitter**
As part of [our Twitter tips series](https://buffer.com/library/twitter-tips-for-beginners/), we mentioned how you can [supercharge your Twitter experience with shortcuts](https://buffer.com/library/advanced-twitter-tips/). Twitter makes it as simple as possible by using up key real estate in their drop down menu to link to their full list of shortcuts. Here are a few favorites:
g + i = Takes me directly to my Twitter lists
j = next Tweet
k = previous Tweet
Enter = open Tweet details
You can view the full list of shortcuts by clicking on More > Settings and Support > and selecting Keyboard Shortcuts.
![](https://buffer.com/library/content/images/2023/04/Twitter-Shortcuts-Logo.png)
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Facebook**
Facebook keyboard shortcuts differ by operating system and browser. For Mac, all of Facebook’s navigational shortcuts in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome start with Control and Option and followed by a number.
Here are where each of the 10 numbers takes you:
0 – Help
1 – Home
2 – Timeline/Feed
3 – Friends
4 – Inbox
5 – Notifications
6 – Settings
7 – Activity Log
8 – About
9 – Terms
In addition, there are a few regular shortcuts that can make browsing Facebook even faster.
j/k = scroll up/down between News Feed stories
l = like or unlike a post
c = comment on a post
s = share a post
p = post a new status update
/ = search
Typing a question mark will open the full list of Facebook shortcuts.
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Mastodon**
Mastodon is a new social media platform that aims to be more decentralized and user-friendly than other mainstream options. It's based on a federated system of servers, which means users can join different communities or "instances" that have their own rules and moderation. Mastodon has extensive keyboard shortcuts, which allow users to navigate the platform more efficiently and quickly. These shortcuts include everything from composing new posts to searching for specific content or users. To see a full list of keyboard shortcuts, simply type ? anywhere on Mastodon. 
R = reply to post
M = mention author
F = favorite post
B = boost post
O = open post
G+H = open home timeline
G+L = open local timeline
G+F = open federated timeline
![](https://buffer.com/library/content/images/2023/04/Mastodon-Shortcuts-Logo.png)
## **Keyboard shortcuts for YouTube**
Are you a fan of YouTube? We’ve started [building more videos ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfe5mZb27I49XSATiOZeKJw) here at Buffer, so we’re excited to learn more about how everything works. We also love watching cool vids! Here are some ways we’ve found to watch even faster.
1 = jump ahead to 10% through a video
5 = jump ahead to 50%
Any other single digit = jump ahead to a certain percentage through a video (e.g., 3 = 30%, 4 = 40%)
0 = starts the video over from the beginning
<Spacebar> = pauses/unpauses the video
![](https://buffer.com/library/content/images/2023/04/YouTube-Shortcuts-Logo.png)
Here are even more shortcuts for YouTube, [courtesy of Hong Kiat](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/youtube-keyboard-shortcuts/).
## **Keyboard shortcuts for WordPress**
We use WordPress every day for composing our blog posts here at Buffer, so we’ve picked up a few tricks along the way. If you ever want to view the full list of keyboard shortcuts inside your WordPress editor, click on the question mark icon from the editor menu.
![](https://buffer.com/library/content/images/2023/04/Wordpress-Shortcuts-Logo.png)
Here are a few of my personal favorites:
<Command>+ 2, 3, or 4 = Heading 2, 3, or 4 wherever your cursor currently is
<Alt>+<Shift>+a = add a link
<Alt>+<Shift>+m = insert an image
(I use distraction-free writing mode when I’m composing in WordPress, and there’s a neat shortcut that lets you resize the width of the distraction-free editor. Press <Control>+plus/minus to change the width.)
To see the full list of WordPress shortcuts, you can click the question mark icon in the menu bar of your post editor, or use the shortcut <Alt>+<Shift>+h.
![](https://buffer.com/library/content/images/2023/04/Rich-Editor-Help-Logo.png)
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Pocket**
I’ve found Pocket to be an ideal part of my [researching](https://buffer.com/resources/how-we-research-a-look-inside-the-buffer-blog-process/) and [reading](https://buffer.com/resources/how-to-read-more-and-remember-it-all/) habit, and it’s great to learn new ways to make this tool even more useful. Here are a couple.
<Command>+1 = go to homepage (View Menu)
<Command>+2 = go to favorites (View Menu)
<Command>+3 = go to archive (View Menu)
a = Archive (Item Menu)
f = Favorite (Item Menu)
![](https://buffer.com/library/content/images/2023/04/Pocket-for-Mac-Shortcuts-Logo.png)
The complete list of keyboard shortcuts can be found [here](http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/805887-keyboard-shortcuts-in-pocket-for-mac).
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Mac**
We are pretty big Apple fans at Buffer and we’ve learned some pretty nifty tricks to fly through our workflows just as fast as possible. Here are a few of our favorite tips:
<Command>+<Spacebar> = opens Spotlight search so you can search your Mac for anything (files, apps, etc.)
<Command>+up/down = scroll to top/bottom of a page or document
<Command>+h = hides the active window
<Command>+<Tab> = switches between open applications
<Command>+d = functions as the delete key
<Command>+<Shift>+4, then <Spacebar> = the first part of this shortcut lets you take a screenshot of anything you see. Just press the hotkeys then click and drag the crosshair cursor over the area you want to grab. If you’d like to take a screenshot of an entire window, press spacebar once the crosshair cursor appears.
Here is a huge list of [even more shortcuts for Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236).
## **Mac accessibility shortcuts**
<Command>+F5 = turn VoiceOver on or off
Option+<Command>+8 = turn zoom on or off
Option+<Command>+Plus sign (+) = zoom in
Option+<Command>+Minus sign (-) = zoom out
Control+Option+Command+8 = invert colors
Control+Option+<Command>+Comma (,) = reduce contrast
Control+Option+<Command>+Period (.) = increase contrast
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Windows**

Before joining Buffer, I worked at a company that exclusively used PCs, so I learned a number of different ways to work quickly in Windows. I get the sense that a lot of you might be on a PC too, so if I overlooked any of your favorite shortcuts , please add them to the comments!
<Alt>+home/end = scrolls to the top/bottom of a window/page
<Alt>+<Tab> = switch between open windows
<Windows>+d = show desktop
F2 = rename a selected file or folder
<Windows>+<Print Screen> = take a screenshot ands save it to a “screenshots” folder in your pictures
<Windows>+m = minimize all windows
<Control>+scroll = in windows explorer, this cycles through viewing options and changes folder sizes
There are tons more [Windows keyboard shortcuts](http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboardshortcuts/comments/1v30ze/windows_keyboard_shortcuts_that_i_find_very_useful/), too.
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Google Docs**
When I’m not writing in WordPress, I’m writing in Google Docs. A lot of the most useful keyboard shortcuts in Docs are similar to the common ones you use in a lot of other places: copy, cut, paste, etc. That being said, here are three unique ones that save me a bit of time.
<Command>+k = insert link
<Command>+<Shift>+c = word count
<Command>+<Option>+m = insert a comment
Here is the full list of [Google Docs keyboard shortcuts](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179738?hl=en).
## **Keyboard shortcuts for browsers**
Most browsers can be sped up the same way with similar shortcuts across each. You’re likely familiar with a few of these. Did I miss any of your favorites?
<Command>+n = opens a new window
<Command>+t = opens a new tab
<Command>+w = closes the current tab
<Command>+<Shift>+t = opens the most recently closed tab(s)
<Command>+<Shift>+n = opens a new Incognito window (great for seeing how someone else might experience a page if they’re not logged in as you)
<Command>+l = places your cursor in the address bar
<Command>+plus/minus = increases/decreases the zoom on the page (<Command>+zero resets everything to default)
## **Keyboard shortcuts for Dropbox**
Dropbox has been a huge help for me to digitize parts of my life that used to take up boxes and boxes in my office. Now that there’s a whole bunch of files there, it’s been fun to figure out how to surf them even faster. Here are a few tips:
/ = search
left = go up a folder
right = open a selected folder
<Enter> = download or open a file
F2 = rename a selected file
You can access the full list of Dropbox keyboard shortcuts by typing a question mark within Dropbox.

Gt = today
ga = view all
gg = jump to
gl = read later
m = mark as read
