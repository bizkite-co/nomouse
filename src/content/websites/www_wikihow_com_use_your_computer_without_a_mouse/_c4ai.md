This wikiHow teaches you how to navigate your computer without using a mouse. You can easily move the cursor, click, and more by using the "Mouse Keys" feature on most Windows computers and all Macs. Alternatively, you can use a combination of keyboard shortcuts and the arrow keys to get around. Whether your mouse isn't working or you'd just prefer to use the keyboard, this wikiHow guide will walk you through setting up Mouse Keys on your computer. 
##  Operating a Computer Without a Mouse
  * Use keyboard shortcuts on Windows and Mac to navigate and click.
  * On Windows, you can use the Mouse Keys features if you have a number pad.
  * On Mac, you can use Mouse Keys on any keyboard.

  1. [![Step 1 Try using basic keyboard shortcuts.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/73/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-1-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse#/Image:Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-1-Version-3.jpg)

**Try using basic keyboard shortcuts.** You can use your PC's arrow keys and the `↵ Enter` key to move the selection around the currently-open window, which is helpful if your mouse isn't working. When doing this, you can press a letter key when on the desktop or in a Windows app (e.g., File Explorer) to cause the selection to jump to the first item starting with that letter. There are a few other basic keyboard shortcuts you can use:[[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse#_note-1) X [Trustworthy Source](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience) Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. [Go to source](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse)
     * `Ctrl`+`Esc` — Open the [Start menu](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-the-Windows-10-Start-Menu "Use the Windows 10 Start Menu"). Use the **Tab** key to switch from section to section, and the arrow keys to move within sections. Press **Enter** to launch an app.
     * `⊞ Win`+`D` — Minimize all open windows to show the desktop. Use the **Tab** key to switch from icon to icon, and press **Enter** to start an app.
     * `Alt`+`Tab ↹` — Switch between open windows.
     * `Alt`+`F4` — [Close the currently open app](https://www.wikihow.com/Close-Apps-in-Windows-10 "Close Apps in Windows 10") or window.
     * `⊞ Win`+`E` — [Open the File Explorer](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-File-Explorer "Open File Explorer").
     * `⊞ Win`+`X` — Open the Advanced settings menu.
     * `⊞ Win`+`I` — Open Settings.
     * `⊞ Win`+`A` — Open the Action Center.
     * `⊞ Win`+`⎙ Print Screen` — This will [take a screenshot](https://www.wikihow.com/Take-a-Screenshot-in-Microsoft-Windows "Take a Screenshot in Microsoft Windows") of the entire screen.
  2. [![Step 2 Make sure your computer has a number pad.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/60/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-2-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse#/Image:Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-2-Version-3.jpg)

**Make sure your computer has a number pad.** If you don't have a grid of number keys on the right side of your computer's keyboard (in addition to the standard row of number keys at the top of the keyboard), you won't be able to use this method. 
     * If you don’t have a numeric keypad and your mouse isn't working, see [How to Use a Keyboard to Click Instead of a Mouse](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Keyboard-to-Click-Instead-of-a-Mouse "Use a Keyboard to Click Instead of a Mouse") for tips on navigating without your mouse.
     * You can still use the keyboard shortcuts listed in the first step without a numeric keypad.

11
**Adjust the pointer speed.** Press the `↓` key until you've selected the "Top speed" slider in the "Pointer speed" section. Once you adjust one value, you can press the `Tab ↹` key to move to the next one: 
     * _Top speed_ — Determines how fast your pointer moves at its quickest. Press the `→` key to raise the mouse's top speed, or press `←` to lower it. This setting should be fairly high (e.g., 75 percent or higher).
     * _Acceleration_ — Determines how quickly your pointer reaches its maximum speed. Press the `→` key to raise the acceleration, or press `←` to lower it. This setting should be at around 50 percent.
  12. [![Step 12 Select OK.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/df/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-11-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse#/Image:Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-11-Version-2.jpg)
12
**Select**OK**.** Press the `Tab ↹` key until you see the an outline surrounding the "OK" button at the bottom of the panel. Then, press **Spacebar** to "click" the button. It's at the very bottom of the window. This will enable Mouse Keys and exit the window. 
  13. [![Step 13 Use the number pad to move around the pointer.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/58/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-13-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse#/Image:Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-13-Version-3.jpg)
13
**Use the number pad to move around the pointer.** You can now use the numeric keyboard to move your mouse cursor around the screen like a mouse: 
     * `4`: Move left
     * `6`: Move right
     * `8`: Move up
     * `2`: Move down
     * `7`: Move up diagonally to the left
     * `9`: Move up diagonally to the right
     * `1`: Move down diagonally to the left
     * `3`: Move down diagonally to the right
     * If your mouse doesn't start moving, press `Num` (or `Fn`+`Num` on some computers), then try moving your mouse again.
  14. [![Step 14 Press the 5 key to click.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse#/Image:Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)
14
**Press the**`5`** key to click.** You'll find this key in the middle of the number pad. 
     * If pressing `5` brings up a drop-down menu, press `/` in the number pad to disable this feature. You should be able to click using `5` after doing so.
  15. [![Step 15 Bring up the right-click menu.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-14-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse#/Image:Use-Your-Computer-Without-a-Mouse-Step-14-Version-2.jpg)
15
**Bring up the right-click menu.** Every Windows computer has a "context menu" key that usually resembles a ☰ symbol surrounded by a box. With an item (e.g., an icon) selected, pressing this key will prompt the right-click menu to appear. 
     * Keep in mind that without first clicking something by using the `5` key, the right-click menu will just display a generic drop-down in the corner of the screen.
     * You can also do a variety of computer operations [using the Windows command prompt](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows "Open Terminal in Windows").
     * For general keyboard tips, check out [our guide to using a computer keyboard](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Computer-Keyboard "Use a Computer Keyboard").
