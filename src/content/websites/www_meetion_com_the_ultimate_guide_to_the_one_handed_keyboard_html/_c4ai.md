Finding the [**best one-handed keyboard**](https://www.meetion.com/mt-kb015.html) can be challenging. Many factors affect usage scenarios. This guide will explore all the options in the one-handed keyboard category. We will start with the types of one-handed keyboards, their key specifications, and their ergonomics.
## **Types of One-Handed Keyboards**
Understanding the types of one-handed keyboards is essential to find the perfect match for your requirements. Whether you are a gamer, programmer, video editor, or typist, exploring these categories will help you find the ideal match.
### 1. One-Handed Gaming Keypad
The one-handed keypad is the most popular and widely available type of one-handed keyboard. It intends to maximize the area for mouse movement while allowing an ergonomic hand position to avoid wrist problems. These keyboards do not necessarily offer the same alphanumeric sections as the full-scale keyboard but provide a decent number of keys for maximum control.
These keypads are usually meant to enhance the gaming experience, but there are options that are also ideal for daily usage. They also feature macros that allow users to map keys they want to a specific key.
### 2. Ergonomic One-Handed Keyboard
There are also ergonomic one-handed keyboards that directly address the health issues associated with excessive typing or keyboard usage. These keyboards alleviate wrist, forearm, neck, and shoulder pain. You can place the one-handed keyboard directly in line with the shoulder so the user's muscles do not stretch unnaturally.
Computer users also improve posture and productivity due to reduced fatigue. Carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis, muscle strain, and repetitive strain injury (RSI) are all common problems for computer users.
### 3. Full-Size One Handed Keyboard
Considering the requirement that people only use a single hand for typing, manufacturers developed the full-size one-handed keyboard. It includes all the keys that are standard to the QWERTY layout keyboard. The intention is to allow a whole typing experience using only one hand.
The choices in full-size, one-handed keyboards are limited. Some keyboards have an ergonomic design that allows for high words per minute.
### 4. Miniature One-Handed Keyboard
These miniature keyboards comfortably fit a single hand. Many brands offer keyboards with a minimum of 20 keys. They use the chording technique to achieve the full alphanumeric keypad. Users can type 85% of English words without using the chording technique.
It does not have a layout similar to the QWERTY keyboards we use. There is a learning curve, but most users have had an excellent experience using these keyboards after the process.
## **Guidelines for Selecting the Best One-Handed Keyboard**
If you want to buy a one-handed keyboard for your daily use, here are easy-to-follow guidelines to help you decide.
1. First, identify your usage. Answer the following questions to move further in the guideline.
a. Are you a gamer or video editor, or can you use one hand to type?
b. Are you willing to learn a new layout to ensure one-handed typing?
c. Do you need a mechanical switch for a one-handed keyboard?
2. After answering the question, we can select a device. If you are a gamer, look for a gamepad.
3. If you are a video editor, gamepads and ergonomic one-handed keyboards are for you.
4. Get a full-size one-handed keyboard if you are a typist who requires one-hand typing.
5. Enthusiasts who want complete control and typing speed can use miniature one-handed keyboards.
