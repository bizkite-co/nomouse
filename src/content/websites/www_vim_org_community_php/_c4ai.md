# The Vim Community
Some people say that vi users are a rabid pack of fanatical lunatics. We prefer to think of ourselves as community of users who have found a piece of software that perfectly meets our needs. We like to help our fellow users whenever we can. 
# Questions and Answers
A very active place these days to get help from others is you don't know how to do something is [Stackexchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com). It's a bit like stackoverflow but for users. 
# Mailing Lists
There are several "official" mailing lists for Vim. Please note that to post on these lists, **you must be a member** (except for vim-announce, you cannot post there). To subscribe, send an empty message to [list-name]-subscribe@vim.org.  | address | description  
---|---  
[vim-announce@vim.org](https://www.vim.org/maillist.php#announce) | Announcements only: new releases and important patches  
[vim@vim.org](https://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim) | Help on vim and vim usage  
[vim-dev@vim.org](https://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim-dev) | Discussion on current vim development  
[vim-mac@vim.org](https://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim-mac) | Vim use and development discussion specific to mac  
[vim-security@googlegroups.com](https://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim-security) | Vim internal, non-public list for discussing potential security issues  
Quoting Leonid Mamtchenkov: "Until now I thought only that the Vim mailing list was very informative and fast-responding. Now I also think that it is one of the kindest I've came across. :) Thumbs up!" 
Plenty of other groups and mailing lists exist, and are described more fully on [their own page](https://www.vim.org/maillist.php). 
# IRC Channels
If mailing lists don't provide the quick reply and razor wit you need, you can look for Vim users on IRC at these networks: 
network | common server | channel | comment  
---|---|---|---  
freenode | irc.freenode.net | #vim | very active; [web page](https://vi-improved.org/)  
IRCnet | #vim  
# USENET Newsgroups
Vim is discussed on USENET -- what isn't? You can find Vim discussion on comp.editors on your local NNTP server. Or look at the [Google archive](https://groups.google.com/group/comp.editors). 
# Web Pages
Vim.org might be the official vim web page, but it's hardly the only one. There are plenty of them, listed both in [our registry](https://www.vim.org/web.php) and on [the Vim webring](http://u.webring.com/hub?ring=vim). 
# Wiki
Another wiki is at wikibooks: [learning the vi editor](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_Editor), there is a section specifically for Vim, the rest is regular Vi. 
The tips have been moved to the [Vim Tips wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki).
