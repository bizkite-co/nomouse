## Public Safety Broadband Communications
**DEDICATED NETWORKS FOR POLICE, FIRE, AND EMS**
The 700 MHz Band is a critical spectrum in public safety communications. Designated by Congress as a public safety spectrum unavailable to commercial operators, the so-called D-Block band (758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz) has excellent properties for first responder communications. 700 MHz signals easily penetrate buildings and walls and cover large geographic areas. MCA is a licensed dealer of all three of the major first responder network platforms: AT&T FirstNet, Verizon Frontline, and T-Mobile's T-Priority program.
[![AT&T FirstNet for First Responders](https://lte.callmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USAT-FRN-FirstNet-Logo.jpg)](https://lte.callmc.com/solutions/first-responder-networks/#firstnet)

[![T-Priority from T-Mobile](https://lte.callmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/T-Priority-Logo.jpg)](https://lte.callmc.com/solutions/first-responder-networks/#heroes)
