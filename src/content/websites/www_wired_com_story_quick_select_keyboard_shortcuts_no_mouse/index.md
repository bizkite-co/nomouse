This article explains how to use a computer without a mouse or trackpad by utilizing keyboard shortcuts.

**For Windows:**

*   **Win** opens the Start menu.
*   **Alt+Tab** switches between applications.
*   **Alt+F4** closes programs.
*   **Tab** navigates between sections, and arrow keys move within them.
*   **Win+S** searches the computer.
*   **Win+E** opens File Explorer.
*   **Enter** confirms selections, **Esc** exits menus.
*   **Win+Up/Down** maximizes/minimizes windows.
*   **Win+Left/Right** snaps windows to the sides.
*   **Alt+Space** provides more window options.
*   **Space** scrolls down pages.
*   **Shift+F10** accesses right-click context menus.
*   Underlined characters in menus indicate direct selection keys.

*   **Cmd+M** minimizes windows.
*   Menu items often display their keyboard shortcuts.
