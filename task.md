# Task 5: Update Playwright Test for CSS Link Verification
**Outcome:** Test updated successfully.

---
**Task 5 Result (Executed 2025-03-26 ~10:52 PM PST):**
Playwright test `tests/website-page.spec.ts` updated successfully to check for the CSS link tag.

---

# Task 6: Restart Dev Server, Clear Caches, and Run Updated Playwright Test
**Outcome:** Test **FAILED**. The dev server is not including the CSS link tag even after restart and cache clear with `cssCodeSplit: false`.

---

# Task 7: Test Explicit Component Import (Test 2 from Task 4 Plan)
**Outcome:** Test **FAILED**. Explicitly importing `Navbar` into `[urlPath].astro` did not force the dev server to include the CSS link tag.

---

# Task 8: Revert Test 2 Changes
**Outcome:** `src/pages/websites/[urlPath].astro` reverted successfully to baseline state.

---

# Task 9: Retry `<style is:global>` in Layout
**Outcome:** Test **FAILED**. Using `<style is:global>` in `Layout.astro` did not force the dev server to include the CSS link tag. Code reverted to baseline.

---

# Task 10: Verify Playwright Test Locator Against Index Page
**Outcome:** Test **FAILED**. Locator `head link[rel="stylesheet"][href^="/_astro/"]` did not find the link on the index page in dev mode.

---

# Task 11: Re-examine Served HTML & Refine Test Locator
**Outcome:** Test **PASSED**. Identified dev server uses `<style data-vite-dev-id="...">`. Updated locator to `page.locator('head style[data-vite-dev-id]').first()`. Test passed against index page (`/`). Test file reverted to target dynamic route.

---

# Task 12: Run Updated Playwright Test Against Dynamic Route (Dev Server)
**Outcome:** Test **PASSED**. The updated locator found the injected `<style>` tag on the dynamic route served by the dev server. Confirmed dev server applies styles correctly.

---

# Task 13: Ensure Build Configuration for Production
**Outcome:** `astro.config.mjs` updated successfully with `vite: { build: { cssCodeSplit: false } }`.

---

# Task 14: Verify Markdown Rendering

**Goal:** Diagnose why Markdown content fetched via content collections is not rendering as HTML in `[urlPath].astro`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Modify `[urlPath].astro`:**
    *   Add `console.log('Markdown Body:', entry.body);` in the frontmatter to log the raw Markdown.
    *   Temporarily remove the `div` wrapper with `prose` classes around the `<Content />` component to simplify.
    ```astro
    ---
    // ... imports ...
    const { entry } = Astro.props;
    if (!entry) { /* ... */ }
    console.log('Markdown Body:', entry.body); // Add log
    const { Content } = await entry.render();
    ---
    <Layout title={entry.data.title || 'Website Details'}>
      <main class="container mx-auto px-4 md:px-0 py-8">
        {/* ... other elements ... */}
        <div class="my-4">
          {/* ... Tags ... */}
          {/* Temporarily remove prose wrapper */}
          <Content />
        </div>
        {/* ... Visit Website link ... */}
      </main>
    </Layout>
    ```
2.  **Request User Action (Restart Server):** Ask the user to **stop** the current `npm run dev` process, clear caches (`rm -rf .astro`), **restart** the dev server (`npm run dev`), and clear browser cache.
3.  **Verify Output:** Ask the user to:
    *   Check the dynamic page (e.g., `/websites/github_com_pluja_awesome_privacy`) in the browser. Is the Markdown rendered as HTML now?
    *   Check the terminal running the dev server for the "Markdown Body:" log output. Does it show the expected Markdown content?
4.  **Document Result in `task.md`:** **Append the outcome of Task 14 to this file.** Note whether the Markdown rendered and if the log showed the expected content.

---
**Task 14 Result (Executed 2025-03-28 ~8:12 AM PST):**
**Outcome:** Markdown rendering **SUCCESSFUL**.

**Diagnosis:**
*   Initial debugging attempts on `src/pages/websites/[urlPath].astro` failed because a conflicting dynamic route file, `src/pages/websites/[filename].astro`, was actually handling the requests. This caused logs and changes in `[urlPath].astro` to have no effect.
*   The active `[filename].astro` file used a manual `fs`/`gray-matter` approach, which did *not* include a step to convert the Markdown string to HTML before rendering with `set:html`, resulting in raw Markdown being displayed.
*   **Resolution:** The conflicting `[filename].astro` and `[id].astro` files were removed. The `[urlPath].astro` file was confirmed to be using the Astro Content Collections API (`getCollection`, `entry.render()`, `<Content />`).
*   After ensuring `[urlPath].astro` was the sole dynamic route and correctly using Content Collections, restarting the dev server confirmed that the `<Content />` component now correctly renders the Markdown content as HTML.
*   Diagnostic logs were removed, and `prose` styling was restored to `[urlPath].astro`.
