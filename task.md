# Task 5: Update Playwright Test for CSS Link Verification
**Outcome:** Test updated successfully.

---
**Task 5 Result (Executed 2025-03-26 ~10:52 PM PST):**
Playwright test `tests/website-page.spec.ts` updated successfully to check for the CSS link tag.

---

# Task 6: Restart Dev Server, Clear Caches, and Run Updated Playwright Test
**Outcome:** Test **FAILED**. The dev server is not including the CSS link tag even after restart and cache clear with `cssCodeSplit: false`.

---

# Task 7: Test Explicit Component Import (Test 2 from Task 4 Plan)
**Outcome:** Test **FAILED**. Explicitly importing `Navbar` into `[urlPath].astro` did not force the dev server to include the CSS link tag.

---

# Task 8: Revert Test 2 Changes
**Outcome:** `src/pages/websites/[urlPath].astro` reverted successfully to baseline state.

---

# Task 9: Retry `<style is:global>` in Layout
**Outcome:** Test **FAILED**. Using `<style is:global>` in `Layout.astro` did not force the dev server to include the CSS link tag. Code reverted to baseline.

---

# Task 10: Verify Playwright Test Locator Against Index Page
**Outcome:** Test **FAILED**. Locator `head link[rel="stylesheet"][href^="/_astro/"]` did not find the link on the index page in dev mode.

---

# Task 11: Re-examine Served HTML & Refine Test Locator
**Outcome:** Test **PASSED**. Identified dev server uses `<style data-vite-dev-id="...">`. Updated locator to `page.locator('head style[data-vite-dev-id]').first()`. Test passed against index page (`/`). Test file reverted to target dynamic route.

---

# Task 12: Run Updated Playwright Test Against Dynamic Route (Dev Server)
**Outcome:** Test **PASSED**. The updated locator found the injected `<style>` tag on the dynamic route served by the dev server. This confirms the dev server *is* applying styles correctly with the current baseline code. The initial user report was likely due to caching.

# Task 13: Ensure Build Configuration for Production

**Goal:** Ensure the `astro.config.mjs` file contains the necessary setting (`cssCodeSplit: false`) for correct CSS linking in production builds.

**Steps:**

1.  **Read `astro.config.mjs`:** Check the current content.
2.  **Modify `astro.config.mjs` (If Necessary):** Add or ensure the `vite: { build: { cssCodeSplit: false } }` configuration is present. The final config should look similar to this:
    ```javascript
    // astro.config.mjs
    import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
    import react from "@astrojs/react";
    import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";

    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [react(), tailwind({ applyBaseStyles: false })], // Keep applyBaseStyles: false
      vite: {
        build: {
          cssCodeSplit: false, // Ensure this is present
        },
      },
    });
    ```
3.  **Save Changes:** Write the updated code back if modifications were made.
4.  **Append Result to `task.md`:** Append a confirmation message indicating that the build configuration has been verified/updated.
